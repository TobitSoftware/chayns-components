# Accordion-Component #

The Accordion-Component is part of the *tobit-chayns_components* package. It can be installed via npm:

    npm install --save-dev tobit-chayns_components

The Accordion-Component hides(actually removes) all child elements when it gets closed and makes the webpage faster. This gets very useful if many elements are stored in the accordion or if there are even wrapped accordions.

## Usage of the Accordions ##
At first the component has to be imported:

```jsx
import Accordion from 'tobit-chayns_components/react-chayns-accordion';
```


Then it can be used like in the following:
```jsx
	<Accordion head="Hallo">
		<div className="accordion__content">
			Hello World!
		</div>
	</Accordion>
```

### Examples
#### Accordion-Badge
The Accordion-Component allows you to create badges using a prop. The badge wont be created it the props are falsely.
```jsx
<Accordion head="No JSX" badge="15.02.">
	<div className="accordion__content">
		<Calendar />
	</div>
</Accordion>
```
#### Always render content
The content of an accordion can be rendered anytime instead of just when opening it. This function is set to false by default, since it is rarely used.
I.e. it is useful if it is necessary to execute JavaScript-Code that is stored inside this accordion.
```jsx
<Accordion head="No JSX" renderClosed={true}>
	<div className="accordion__content">
		<MyAwesomeES5Script />
	</div>
</Accordion>
```
